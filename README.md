Refamished addon for BTW 3.0 (snapshot 3a maybe thats the name)

# [The fucking wiki](https://github.com/JespacitoSoCool/Refamished/wiki)

Aint no way an addon needs a wiki 😭

# So... what the addon does?

To not spoil a lot of shit, I will just tell some of the most important changes :

* Changes and overhaul of progression, extending it and fitting more between ages

* Tools have an upgrade at the cost of more preparation and time consuming

* Materials, Alloys, such as Copper, Gilded Iron and Rose Gold

* Adds a new forging, smithing and plannification system!

* Adds uses to more items such as Sugar!

* Chipping, Knapping, Sharpening...

* Changes on world generation

* Edible sugar, Pies, Berries...

* A Tinkering system

* Changes on mobs

* More shit

hehe, made stairs with the list

# B-B-But.... I want more difficulty, this mod is too easy! >_<

This mod is too easy, heh buddy, Minecraft Is Too Easy.. 😏 (this is a call for help)

This mod can also be an --> --> --> --> OPTIONAL <-- <-- <-- difficulty mod.

Just change the world difficulty to-

### C R U E L
### M O D E

and there you have it!

A --> BIT <-- exagerated difficulty where time and mistakes will consume you alive

Mobs behavior changes

Also blocks behavior does

Good luck with the skeletons, at this point if I give them an ak-47 their fire rate will slice in half...

huh...
